### Our Lady of La Porteria Parish History

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

--   Calabanga was one of Quipayo's visits when it was established as a parish in 1578. It had authority over the parishes of Libmanan, Bombon, Siruma, and Calabanga. Bombon was established in 1804 and came to Magarao in 1908.

Calabanga separated from Quipayo as a consequence of a petition submitted by a group of Calabangueos with the aim of constructing another Church that, along with a Padre Ministro, would care for the people's needs. The petitioners also hoped that by separating the Visitas of Pagatpat and Inarihan, they would be administered more carefully because they were so close to each other. It had two visits, Visita de Cagapad which is in Pagatpat, and Visita de Hinarijan, as well as 12 barrios: San Antonio, San Vicente, Santa Catalina, and Nstra. San Lucas, San Miguel, Sta. Isabel, Nostra. del Carmen, San Roque, San Pablo, San Jose now Balongay, and Belen.

--    On April 28, 1749, the petition was submitted. On July 15, 1749, the petition was granted by Don Fray Juan de Arecherra, Bishop elect of Nueva Segovia of the Commissary of the King, along with the establishment of the Municipality of Calabanga. The first Parish Priest was Fray Jose de la Bastida, O.F.M. At the moment, the Parish has 15 Barangays with the establishment of new Parishes: the Divine Mercy Parish in Paolbo, Calabanga founded on June 30, 2003 - celebrating their feast on the 2nd Sunday of Easter and St. Faustina Kowalska is the Secondary Patron; the Black Nazarene Parish in Binanuanan Pequeo, Calabanga founded on August 29, 2009, celebrating their feast on January 9 and Nuestra Seora de la Paz Domingo, Calabanga was formed on October 18, 2009, with St. Dominic of Guzman as its Secondary Patron and was launched by The Archbishop of Caceres, His Excellency Most Reverend Leonardo Z. Legaspi. The Parish fiesta is now held on September 8, the feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

In 1667, the first stone church was built. However, in 1811, an earthquake destroyed it. It was then renovated in 1849 under the leadership of Fray Francisco Baydal, and again in 1874 and 1897 under the guidance of Fray Herrejon, O.F.M (Town Fiesta Souvenir Programme, 1996). The same structure has been renovated to its current state. Fr. In 1923, Sergio Villareal built the ancient parish rectory. Then, thanks to Rev. Fr. Raul S. Pan, a new P 2.2 million parish rectory was built to replace the 76-year-old convent. From October 1997 to April 1999, the new rectory took 18 months to complete.

--    Msgr. On April 4, 1999, the Vicar General of Caceres, Jose R. Rojas, blessed the new rectory. The former convent is now a formation house. Other initiatives included the creation of the Jubilee Gazebo, which had an 8-meter diameter. The Parish Church's sanctuary was removed and rebuilt, and its roof was replaced with new GI sheets. The side altars where the various images were placed were renovated. The entire Church's flooring was redone with new tiles. From its inception in 1749 till now, there have been around 67 Parish Priests and 24 Calabangueo Priests "chosen" to serve the Lord. The Parish is also the home parish of two priest brothers, Frs. Frs. Sebastian Vely and Benedicto. Frs. Pedro and Salvador Dumalasa. Tirso and Benedicto Elopre, as well as Frs. Vito with his son, Wenceslao San Andres Jr. Parroquia de la Inmaculada Concepcion, Finding of the Holy Cross, Divine Mercy Parish, Black Nazarene Parish, and St. Peregrine of Laziosi Parish are all under the jurisdiction of the Vicariate of Our Lady of La Porteria.
