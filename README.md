*The expression "genesis" has multiple meanings in different settings, each containing the underlying concept of origin or beginning. "Genesis" is the first book of the Bible in religious traditions, primarily in Judeo-Christian beliefs, chronicling the creation of the universe, the rise of humanity, and the early history of the Israelites.*

### **The Book of Exodus**
*The LORD will fight for you while you only need to keep silent and remain calm. -Exodus 14:14*

![1867_Edward_Poynter_-_Israel_in_Egypt](https://github.com/outmoded1PonGee0/outmoded1PonGee0.github.io/assets/150323782/8a667f59-8942-4319-9fc7-83060513e887)

This digs into the situation of the Israelites, who are captive in Egypt and subjected to severe conditions. Moses, the pivotal figure, emerges as a significant leader and heavenly interventionist. Moses is summoned to confront Pharaoh and seek the emancipation of his people through a series of miracles and heavenly manifestations, including the famous story of the burning bush. The story progresses via dramatic events like as the 10 plagues, each increasing in intensity until the Passover and the Israelites' quick evacuation from Egypt. The tale culminates with a dramatic crossing of the Red Sea, symbolising their freedom from servitude.
